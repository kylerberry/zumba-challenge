- Admins needs to be able to create/edit new music/video entries

- Admins can associate music to music categories (and vice-versa)

- Admins can associate video to video categories (and vice-versa)

- Admins can restrict music/video by some benefit or by a range of dates

- ZIN members can see the categories and the number of music/videos that the user can access

- ZIN members should receive different messages if they can't see the content because of insufficient benefit or if the content is not in a valid date range

- Every music/video streamed by the ZIN on any application needs to be reported and stored in a database (it can be a delayed process if necessary)

- ZIN members love this application and will cause thousands of requests per second, so the system needs to be reliable to support it

- Zumba will create a mobile app that will use the same logic as their web view, sharing the same logic/restrictions on the content
