- Graphql
- Doctrine ORM
- Doctrine notations create type gql definitions using graphql-doctrine

Pros:
    - strict typing and development flow
    - client drives query, and graphql returns least-possible data, efficient queries for various clients (web, native apps, etc.)
    - ORM DataMapper pattern: separation of data and persistence (focus on working with objects)
    - Graphql could be used as a gateway to existing service APIs (unifying endpoint)
Cons:
    - Caching is difficult
    -
